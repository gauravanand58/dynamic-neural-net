## Tasks Completed


*  Created and visualized a two-class Gaussian data and a two-class concentric circles data.
*  Added an option for adding label noise into the dataset, I used default argument noise_prob=0 in generateData() function only which takes in value from 0 to 100 as the probability of noise in labels.
*  Trained a small feedforward neural network
*  Refactored existing code into a cleaner object-oriented form.
*  Allowed a variable number of hidden units into the model.
*  Allowed the various possible activation types.
*  Allowed multiple output units, using softmax and a cross-entropy error.
*  Allowed multiple hidden layers.
